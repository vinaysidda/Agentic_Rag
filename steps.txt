git init - this initializes the empty folder in the root directory 
git add . -- tell git to keep track of this file  
git commit -m "with message you wish  " -- permanently records the current snapshot with a message 

before that you connect the local machine to the 

git remote add origin https://github.com/YourName/awesome-app.git -- git remote add origin(reposotory on the git hub is called 
origin by default)

git branch -M main --earliest version of git had master for the branch and now that git has main  


git push -u origin main  -- you will push this entire file to the repository on the git hub 

git remote -v -- this command tells me what all remote connections this project has 
origin  https://github.com/vinaysidda/demp_git.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/vinaysidda/demp_git.git (push)
(.venv) PS D:\MLOP+AI+Bootcamp\fastapi_rest_demo>


git pull  -- Downloads new commits from the remote branch (origin/main) and merges them into your local branch.

git fetch origin --Downloads only the latest commits from GitHub but does not modify your files.


 git log origin/main - gives the recent log on the branch

Author: vinays <vinays@gmail.com>


git pull --rebase  -- lets assume that i have new code on github after that with this command , you will pull the entire code
and then remove any local commits that you have done do any commits from the remote and then add the local commits on top of that 


git checkout -b feature/login    -- this commnad creates a new branch and then switch to new branch and best way ti  
Switched to a new branch 'feature/login'

git branch --show-current             :-shows which branch are you in now 


# remove git metadata (the .git folder) - WARNING: this removes all git history for this working copy

git init --bare -- git initializes an empty repository with everything but no tree

 git clone central-repo.git alice

 git remote set-url origin https://github.com/vinaysidda/Dumping_github_prac.git --  to change the repository
  
You create your new branch feature/login_bob origin/main starting from the latest commit on the remote branch (origin/main)

other wise with just git check out -b feature/login_bob it will create a from the 
starting commit of the local repository suppose if i am there is the repo of the feature/login (alice)


Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\fastapi_rest_demo\carol  this delte the particluar folder of git in local

List local + remote branches
git branch -a


WHY REBASE IS BETTER THAN MERGE

ex:- Merge branch 'main' into feature/login_bob

History becomes messy.
Keeps history clean and linear:  A → B → C → Bob1 → Bob2

Now push the rebased branch to update remote (use safe force):
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/login_bob
--force-with-lease prevents you from accidentally overwriting someone else’s work.

git push -u origin feature/login_bob --this is the command to push the code on to remote repo using the branch. 

"AI is the broad field of building systems that perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence
(reasoning, perception, language, planning). ML is a subset of AI that learns patterns from data  
to make predictions or decisions. DL is a subset of ML that uses multi-layer neural networks to
learn complex features automatically. Generative AI focuses on creating new content (text, images, code) 
that resembles training data, often built on deep learning models like transformers or GAN"
